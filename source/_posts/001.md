#### About Me

My name is Sijing (SJ) Shao, and I am a current graduate student in quantitative psychology at the University of Notre Dame.

My primary research interest falls in zero-inflated models in intensive longitudinal data as well as in ordinal data. I have worked on serveral project on such topics including a power calculation package for ordinal data and a simulation of zero-inflated models.
